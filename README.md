# ThreatTrace
ThreatTrace is a powerful Bash-based PCAP/PCAPNG analysis toolkit for offline inspection of network captures. It extracts and analyzes critical metadata, protocols, user agents, file transfers, suspicious service:filename patterns, and generates an investigation summary â€” all without needing to open Wireshark.
